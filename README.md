# speechToPoem
Its a simple site that takes a song and outputs a poem
This is my first project on gitHub: Look below to see how to run the program

All you need to do once you clone the repo is to run/open the html file into your browers (recommended :Google Chrome)

Would love any feedback on this project and Thank you for looking at it.
